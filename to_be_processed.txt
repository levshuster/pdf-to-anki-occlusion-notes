tC provides fixed-length arrays
nfixed-length
tarrays occupy a contiguous chunk of memory with the elements in index order
ccontiguous chunk of
cindex 
ta C string is simply an array of char (array of 1-byte values) ending with a null terminator (0x00 or '\0')
carray of char
carray of 1-byte values
n null terminator
c(0x00
c\0
tThe terminator value is crucial because otherwise C has no way of knowing where the string ends
notherwise C has no way of knowing where the string ends
twith #include <string.h>, strlen(s) returns the length of the string (char *) s, not counting the null terminator
cstrlen(s)
nlength of the string (char *) s
cnot counting
twith #include <string.h>, strcpy(dest, src) copies the string at dest to src (both arguments are of type char * (pointers to the start of a char array)
nstrcpy(dest, src)
ncopies the string at dest to src
cchar *
cpointers to the start of a char array
tp->field is shorthand for (*p).field
np->field
n(*p).field
